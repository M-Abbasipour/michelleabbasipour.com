        <!-- programming -->
        <h3 class='narrow'>PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p> While studying for the last four years, I have worked on projects using a range of coding languages which include C, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, JQuery, MySQL and XML. During the third year of my degree, I had to research, design and develop a project to showcase my skills and experience and I created a web app to help mobile beauty businesses manage their bookings, client records and other administration tasks. This project utilised many different software and technologies with the programming written using PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

        <!-- problem solving -->
        <h3 class='narrow'>PROBLEM SOLVING</h3>
        <p> As a programmer, I have a lot of experience of problem solving as a big part of coding is 
            learning to solve puzzles and fix problems.
            A recent example of when I have had to solve a problem is in the website I created for the 
            Web Design Principles module in my Second Year.
            I applied a parallax effect for my background and used Firefox to design the site.
            However, when I tested the site using Chrome, the parallax effect did not work due to Chrome 
            not supporting a vital attribute in the CSS.
            I researched this issue and found several reported solutions which I tried until one of them worked.
            As a result, the website now works in Chrome and Firefox, which can be viewed on my website.

        <!-- idea to final product -->
        <h3 class='narrow'>IDEA TO FINAL PRODUCT</h3>
        <p> In my first and second years I was given assignments which required creating a website 
            from design to development.
            The majority of my third year was spent on a creative technologies project where I chose to 
            research, design and develop a mobile salon management web application.
            This involved user research, testing and evaluation, creating wireframes, static and interactive 
            mockups and then researching the technologies required to implement the design and functionality.
            These projects can be accessed at michelleabbasipour.com
